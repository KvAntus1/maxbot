This is a Discord bot intended to bring love and drama to your Discord servers. It allows two users to get married. There are no benefits to being married. It simply is a thing that you can do. Here's a family tree you can make through marrying and adopting various users:

# Commands

* `m!marry @User#1231`
  * This command lets you propose to another user. They can, of course, then deny your proposal, but that's unimportant
* `m!divorce @User#1231`
  * This does the opposite of the marry command, as you can imagine. It opens you back up to the dating pool.
